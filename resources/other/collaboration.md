# Collaboration

Hello fellow TAs. This is a starter file. Let's make it all nice before we PR back into [ubccpsc/310](https://github.com/ubccpsc/310)

## Meeting With Your Partner

Meeting over Zoom can be really tiring, especially when there is too much of it.
When collaborating with your partner it is important to choose meeting times and frequency that work well for both of you.
This will depend very much on how you choose to approach the project.

- If you start on C1 as it is released and practice good repo hygiene (see below) and planning, you might choose to only meet face to face once per week to catch up on how the sprint is going. But if you start on C1 closer to the deadline and need to develop a solution more rapidly, you will likely need to meet every day or multiple times a day to assign tasks and debug.
- If you want to work collaboratively on the same parts of the system at the same time, you will probably benefit from meeting frequently to talk through problems together. If you like to work separately on distinct tasks, you may choose to meet less frequently to share your progress.

It is a really good idea to take time to think honestly about which side you bias toward. And have a conversation with your partner about it. This way you can avoid meeting too much or too little.

### Recommendations for making the most of your meeting

- **Schedule a regular meeting time.** Luckily, both of you always have a two hour session in the week where you are guaranteed to be free according to your academic calendar. Your lab time is a great place to meet.
- **Start high level.** It's easy for one partner to bring up a problem and then for both of you to get lost in the details of broken code for ages before you realise your time together is up and you both have other classes to get to. In under five minutes each, discuss at a high level what you have accomplished as well as what is blocking you, so you are able to triage your issues before taking any on during your time together.

## Repo Hygiene

- How to write a good commit message...
- Use issues to keep track of what you're working on
  - You can reference an issue in a commit message so your collaborators can see what you're working on
  - You can reference issues in your PR so collaborators know immediately how much is changing with the PR
  - You can use the project kanban to see where issues are at a high level and set deadlines for them
