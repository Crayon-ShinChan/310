Hello fellow TAs. This is a starter file. Let's make it all nice before we PR back into [ubccpsc/310](https://github.com/ubccpsc/310)

## Meeting With Your Partner

- Schedule a regular meeting time
- Delving into code can eat away plenty of your time before you notice it's going anywhere. Start with what you're on and what's blocking you at a high level.

## Repo Hygiene

- How to write a good commit message...
- Use issues to keep track of what you're working on
  - You can reference an issue in a commit message so your collaborators can see what you're working on
  - You can reference issues in your PR so collaborators know immediately how much is changing with the PR
  - You can use the project kanban to see where issues are at a high level and set deadlines for them
